Also important is timing transactions to minimize your tax liabilities - specifically avoiding the short term capital gains tax. Note that this is based on my opinion as a young adult managing finances, and you would have to appropriately balance your risk/profit appropriately as your financial stability requires.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I started programming in Freshman Year of High School, when I got my first personal computer (April 2010). I immediately was mesmerized and got into building graphical desktop apps with <strong>Visual Basic</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my Sophomore Year, I started developing websites and web apps with <strong>PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS</strong> and using the same web technologies, along with <strong>Apache Cordova</strong>, to make hybrid mobile apps. I developed a flash game portal website - My Right To Play, similar to NewGrounds and FreeOnlineGames (FOG), hosting only high-quality flash games along with my friend's own built Adobe Flash games. Junior Year of High School, I balanced between redesigning MRTP multiple times along with developing Game Sanctuary's website, backend and mobile app (Game Sanctuary was a family business we developed that directly competed against GameFly's business model). Senior Year of High School, I entered and won engineering competitions for open-source software development, technological debate, web design and mobile app development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My College years were at first, disappointing but turned highly enjoyable. As I had to redefine who I was from a person who sought external validation to a person who powered through internal inspiration, I was able to turn my grim first years of personal questioning in College to a highly enjoyable experience. Part of this experience is amassing as much programming as I can on my free time - investing in improving my ugly PHP code skills during Freshman year, learning <strong>Javascript</strong>, the NodeJS ecosystem and various libraries/frameworks like Angular my Sophomore Year and picking up intensive <strong>Database and Big Data/Software</strong> architecture scaling principles as well as best application practices in <strong>Python</strong> on my Junior Year. In my classes, I was able to pickup <strong>Java, C, F# and Prolog</strong>, applying some of them even in my own personal projects. Nowadays, I am bent on picking up <strong>Haskell</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also come to lose 90 pounds within 4 months back in May 2012-September 2012 through a rigorous commitment to exercise and eating right. It was a core experience that has helped define my personality to today.
